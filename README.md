# IMDB-bilstm-attention

### About 
Trying to predict movie review sentiments from the [IMDB dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). Mainly for gaining experience with processing language data and RNN/LSTM model implementation on a toy dataset. Used a BiLSTM with attention to classify, as described in [Zhou et al.'s "Attention-Based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks for Relation Classification"](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-2034.pdf).
